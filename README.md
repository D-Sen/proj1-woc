A html-5/Javascript based game playable in a browser, that takes the standard ‘War’ card game and has it take place on a map of a real geographical location. As the base game 'War' is somewhat easy to implement, and the real design comes from the visual and tactile pieces of the interface. I thought this would be a good combination to show my coding skill and also my flair for creativity and design.



## Technologies Used:
HTML - a basic html file in 'html 5', which lays out the base structure for the visual elements. <br />
CSS - does the 'heavy-lifting' for the design elements, in the useful CSS structure and helps the HTML file maintain readability. <br />
JAVASCRIPT(JS) - contains the backend code for processing game input and dynamically changing visual HTML items. <br />

### Requirements: 
A standard computer screen - not optimized for phone or tablet screens! <br />
Web Browser up to date to 2020 standards and all page script elements allowed. <br />


## Getting Started:

Direct link to the game - 
[https://github.com/D-Sen/proj1-WoC](https://github.com/D-Sen/proj1-WoC)

To play the game, load the provided URL into a browser window. Once loaded the player is instructed to pick a location on the map by hovering the mouse pointer over  several pre-chosen areas. The available areas are listed in the left side 'instructional' column of the screen in the beginning of the game. When the player hovers the mouse pointer over any of these areas, a red border will appear to show what areas are selectable. Left clicking one of these 'areas' will encircle the area in red and provide a description of the area in the left informational column, and the "BATTLE" button will become clickable. At this point, click on "BATTLE" to execute the 'War' card game. This process is automated behind the scenes and the result will be displayed. Just like true 'War', card loss or gain is cumlative. The players' card appears on the left, and the foes' on the right.

If a true 'War' is needed, the value of the three face down cards will appear above the final 'War' card (The original card that provokes the 'War' is NOT displayed, but it is considered in the final cumlative results). Only one battle may take place per area; after a VICTORY or DEFEAT, select another area and attempt a battle there. Selecting a previous area where a 'battle' took place will not allow a subsequent 'War' at that location; and will only display a message relating to the previous 'War' result.

To reset the game and refresh the battled areas, click on the 'NEW CAMPAIGN' button at any time during gameplay.
 
_Point of Interest: The square red border only appears the first time the page/game is loaded. After restarting the game from the 'New Campaign' button, these square borders will not appear. Originally used for testing, I thought leaving in these initial borders would help a first-time player understand what areas are interactable._


## Next Steps/Icebox:
* Make the visual design flexible for every possible screen size. 
* Display the original 'War' card when a true 'War' is initiated.
* Add in a brief animation when the engine is selecting the cards when a battle is initiated.
* Brand each location with a different suit, and make visual/gameplay changes accordingly.
* Provide a message after all four of the locations have been fought in relating to the overall success or defeat of the campaign.
